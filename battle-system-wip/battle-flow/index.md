*[Battle flow](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/battle-flow/)* is controlled in turns. [Enemies](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/enemy/) are placed based on their position
in the [battle](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/battle/)'s corresponding [enemy map](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/enemy-map/).

The [player](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/player/) plays first, choosing one of their unlocked and available [battle actions](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/battle-flow/battle-actions/).

Then, the [enemy or enemies](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/enemy/) play their move(s) that're specified in their [enemy](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/enemy/) IDs.

This turn-based combat system proceeds until either the [player](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/player/) successfully [flees](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/battle-flow/battle-actions/flee) or the [player](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/player/)/[enemy](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/config/enemy/) [dies](https://javascriptlearner815.github.io/ka-projects/battle-system-wip/battle-flow/death/).
